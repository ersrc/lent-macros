# LENT - Macros for lecture notetaking

LENT is a collection of macro files for writing notes in troff/groff, eqn
and pic. LENT makes use of the -me macros for troff/groff.

## Files

So far LENT consists of the following files:

`lent-me.lmac`: This file contains general purpose LENT, -me specific macros.

`math-me.lmac`: This file contains useful commands to declare theorems,
proofs, etc.

`eqn.lmac`: This file contains eqn macro definitions for extended math
symbols and notations.

`pic.lmac`: This file contains useful pic macro definitions for drawing with pic.
